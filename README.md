# Gesture-Recognition-for-Smart-Homes

## About the Project:
This project aims to develop a solution to recognise gestures for hand actions that will trigger certain processes involved in a smart home. I've used a pre-trained CNN model to predict gestures.


## Files included:
 - main.py
 - main_train.py
 - handshape_feature_extractor.py
 - frameextractor.py


## Instructions to run the code:
 - Create traindata and test folders in the same directory where you will store the source code
 - Populate the folders with the train videos and test videos of hand gestures
 - Run main_train.py to generate csv files for feature vectors of train frames and output labels
 - Run main.py to recognise gestures and generate results.csv for the test data
 - The Results.csv file will give predict which gestures are present in the test data
